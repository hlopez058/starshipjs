#Starship JS 

A Javascript program that uses vector physics to create a spaceship shooter.

Still a work in progress. I am hoping to clear up the file structure and create amore intuitive object instantiation. Currently collision tracking is my biggest issue. I am trying to track all the collisions and still dispose of objects off screen.
